# Homework-openshift

This is a repository needed for the deployment and configuration of Openshift 3.9 on the homework labs from OPEN Redhat.

### Installation script

The _deploy-openshift.sh_ script in this repo is the same as the one delivered for the assignment. If neccesary the script is provided from the repository.

#### Execute the script

You are able to deploy the entire Openshift Cluster with just one single command.

        ./deploy-openshift.sh

You can either run this in your homefolder or anywhere you want. If you do use the script provided with the repo please move it to your homefolder.

#### Admin user

Once you have installed the cluster the cluster-admin will be configured within the script. You will be able to login to the console with the credentials :

        username : joris
        password : joris

Enjoy Openshift!
